# Introduction

## Project Goals


## Target Audience


# User Stories

User stories were developed in the early stages of the project and prioritised in the workflow using MosCow Prioritisation. I used GitHub's project feature to track development using a Kanban board; moving the user stories into relevant sections as development progressed and labelling with priority tags (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have).
