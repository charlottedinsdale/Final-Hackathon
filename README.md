üìñ **Introduction**

Bonk It is a fun, easy-to-play game testing your reflexes and thinking by challenging you to press on instructed colors. 
Perfect for quick gaming sessions and brain training!

---
üéØ **Target Audience**

The game is designed for anyone who wants to enjoy a simple yet engaging game.  
Players seeking an extra challenge can try the advanced mode, which tests both reflexes and cognitive processing using the  'Stroop Effect' - a psychological phenomenon where the brain experiences conflict between processing the meaning of a word and the color in which it's written.   
For example, if the word "Red" appears in blue ink and you need to press the button corresponding to the word  (Red), your brain must resolve the conflict between the word's meaning and its visual color.

Game Modes

There are 3 games modes.

 - Easy Mode: Basic color matching gameplay. The prompt states the
   colour and is in the colour you need to hit. 
   
 - Hard Mode: Increased difficulty with faster timing. The prompt only states the colour you
   need to hit. 
 
 - Heck Mode:  Advanced gameplay incorporating the 'Stroop Effect' whereby the prompt states the colour you need to hit whilst itself being in another colour.  
   

**Core Features**

The core features of the game are summarised below :

 - User authentication (register, login, logout) 
 - Customizable user profiles 
 - Global leaderboards 
 - Personal statistics tracking 
 - Multiple difficulty levels 
 - Colorblind mode support 
 - Audio feedback and game music
