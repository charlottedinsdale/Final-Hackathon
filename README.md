üìñ **Introduction**

Bonk It is a fun, easy-to-play game testing your reflexes and thinking by challenging you to press on instructed colors.

Perfect for quick gaming sessions and brain training.

  

---

üéØ **Target Audience**

The game is designed for anyone who wants to enjoy a simple yet engaging game.

Players seeking an extra challenge can try the advanced mode, which tests both reflexes and cognitive processing using the 'Stroop Effect' - a psychological phenomenon where the brain experiences conflict between processing the meaning of a word and the color in which it's written.

For example, if the word "Red" appears in blue ink and you need to press the button corresponding to the word (Red), your brain must resolve the conflict between the word's meaning and its visual color.

### Category Descriptions

**Initial Load**  
   Refers to how the game behaves when first accessed or loaded in the browser. It checks whether the page loads quickly, elements are rendered properly, and the layout appears as intended.

**Game Start**  
   Evaluates the functionality when starting a new game, including whether the timer begins as expected and the initial game mechanics are triggered without delays or errors.

**Scoring**  
   Checks the scoring system to ensure that points are awarded or deducted correctly based on user actions and that the score updates instantly on the screen.

**Game End**  
   Examines the behavior when the game ends, ensuring a clean transition to the end screen, displaying the final score accurately, and handling game termination smoothly.

**Responsive**  
   Evaluates how well the game adapts to different screen sizes and devices, particularly mobile devices. It checks if the layout is user-friendly and functional across various resolutions.

**Browsers**  
   Ensures compatibility and consistent performance across different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). It identifies browser-specific issues like animation lag or interaction problems.

**Performance**  
   Tests the game‚Äôs overall responsiveness and speed, especially under varying network conditions or on devices with slower processing power.

**Error Handling**  
    Assesses how well the game manages unexpected errors or invalid inputs, ensuring that issues do not crash the game or disrupt the user experience.

## Summary

- Core functionalities are working as intended.
- Scoring and error handling are robust and reliable.

üîú **Future Features**

  

- Platform-specific timing adjustments for mobile/desktop taking into account that the desktop users play using a mouse or keyboard whilst mobile users play using their hands

  

- Millisecond precision time indicator

- A player can Toggle colorblind mode and be competitive with non-colorblind users. 

- Players can choose a theme they can play to with varying sound effects and colour schemes.  

- A leader board search facility so that players can keep pace of other players scores mroe closely. 

- A 'progress bar timer' so players can see the rate at which  time is depleting and can panic more / feel more thrill / have more fun.
